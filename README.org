* What is this?

A simple tool used for gesture and figure drawing. Images are showed
for a limited amount of time, and the user has to do their best to
draw those images in that limited time

* Why is this?

I wanted to practice figure drawing with my own images, and I found no
free program to do it with, so I made this.

* Features
- (you have to) use your own images
- custom time
- custom session length
- pause
- show previous image
- hide current image on pause (optional)
- skip current image
- play sound before next image (optional)
- contrast adjustment
- black and white mode
- show all the non-skipped images after the session

* How to install

Download the =html= file from this repository and run it with a
browser. That's it, no other files are necessary. It's done this way
to make it run anywhere, and to support most image formats.

* How to use

1. Select the images you want to practice with:
   - You can either select a folder or a bunch of files
   - everything has to be selected at once
   - Uploading multiple times means forgetting your previous uploads
2. Set how long you want to see each image
3. How many images you want to see
4. Press start

* Possible questions
** Where does it upload the images to?
Nowhere. Everything stays on your computer, the page even works completely without internet

** How many images can I upload at the same time?
I tested it with 14012 images on firefox and chrome (Roughly 40 GiB),
and it worked perfectly fine. The most demanding part of this app is
after you finish a session, when all images from the session are
showed at once
